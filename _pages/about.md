# Selected Experience

## EU Projects

I contributed to the [NEWSROOM](https://newsroom-project.eu/) project, funded by the European Defence Fund, as part of my Master's thesis. I developed a proof-of-concept system for secure cyber threat intelligence sharing using blockchain-based technology.

You can read more about the proof-of-concept here.

## Base transceiver station (BTS) integration and verification

I have extensive hands-on experience in the integration, testing, and validation of Nokia’s base station systems, with a focus on synchronization functionality.

Most of my work has been manual testing of both classical and cloud-based BTSs, but I've also dipped my toes in some automation testing and scripting.

During my time at Nokia, I have learned an understanding of BTS and RF technologies, testing methodologies, and several tools like Jira, Jenkins, and Linux-based systems.

## University Projects

I’ve worked on a range of hands-on projects during my studies — from low-level hardware design to high-level software and data processing.

These include things like custom processor design, FPGA programming, custom APIs, IoT data pipelines from sensors to the cloud, as well as graphics and game development in 3D and VR environments.

You can check out some of my public projects here.

## Volunteering

During my studies, I've been actively involved in student life and volunteering.

I served one year as the secretary of OTiT ry, where I took care of meeting minutes, memberlist, mail, and other hot dog jobs.

I also worked multiple years as a journalist for our student guild magazine (Terminaali), writing articles and helping with the editorial process.

I've also worked as a tutor at the University of Oulu, helping new students get started with university life and studies.
