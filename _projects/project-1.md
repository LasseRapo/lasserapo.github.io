## Overview

This project implements a secure, decentralized framework for sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. The system is designed to run on Kubernetes and uses IPFS for distributed storage, ensuring both security and decentralization in CTI sharing.

## Key Features

- **Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Focus on sharing actionable threat intelligence data
- **Blockchain-based Security**: Uses Hyperledger Fabric for secure, immutable CTI records
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Containerized architecture for scalability and reliability
- **IPFS Integration**: Distributed file system for decentralized storage
- **Vault Integration**: Distributed encryption key storage for secure key sharing

## Technology Stack

- Hyperledger Fabric
- Bevel Operator Fabric
- Kubernetes
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- Vault
- Caliper for testing

## Repository

The complete source code, documentation, and deployment instructions are available on GitHub. The repository includes:

- Smart contracts for CTI sharing
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- IPFS and Vault integration components
- Setup and configuration guides
- Caliper workloads for performance testing
